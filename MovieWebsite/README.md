#Movie Trailer Website Project
##By Or Grunebaum

##Project Description
The following project was to design a small movie trailer website showing some of my favorite movies.
In this project I created code to store a list of movie titles, poster images, and movie trailers.
This was then displayed within a webbrowser. The main code for the site was provided by udacity.

The movie information is provided by The Movie Database [theMovieDB](https://themoviedb.org)

##Necessary Packages
To run the code you will need to install a python interface to the Movie Database (PyTMDB3)

I used python 3.4.4 and so I had to use a version of (PyTMDB3) ported for python 3. 
The link below is where I had gotten the code.
  
[PyTMDB3](https://github.com/apelly/pytmdb3)

I had also attached a zipped version of his library.

To use the code I also had to request an API key for the theMovieDB website. 

##Running the software
To run the website open **entertainment_center.py** and press Run/Run module.

##To add more movies 
To add more movies you will need to know the movie index in theMovieDB. Once the movie index has been determined
add it to the `list_movies.extend` using the format `Movie[index]`
